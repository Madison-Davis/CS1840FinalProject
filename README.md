Here are all the relevant folders:
- cs1840final: basically a virtual environment, run it by doing source cs1840final/bin/activate
- Final_Paper.pdf: the author paper
- rlcsp: where we'll run our experiments from, specifically using rlcsp/rlcsp.py and input_FUSE/[one of the input.py files in here]
- FUSE_RL: we won't have to edit this but this just serves as a helpful package for rlcsp to do its thing (plus, it had some nice exmaples to help us set up)
